## Who am I?
My name is Emily and I currently live in Berea, KY with my boyfriend Ben.  I have worked for the Kentucky Trasnportation Cabinet since March of 2018 and am taking this course to further develop and grow my coding abilities.  My job has a heavy data component and I will be taking over the spatial database lead role on January 1 as my amazing mentor, Teri Dowdy, prepares to enter a well earned retirement.  We use quite a bit of coding for application development, ETLs, data cleanup, and data processing and I'm hoping this course helps me develop out those skill sets and gain familiarity with new developments.
## What do I do outside of work?
When I am not working, I thoroughly enjoy being outside and staying active.  I love hiking, backpacking, shooting archery, hunting, sight seeing, cooking, reading, etc... I also enjoy jiu jitsu and muay thai which I started almost 12 years ago.  *Fun fact* I have fought in both Muay Thai and MMA - and I believe some of those fights are still on YouTube.  Although I still am training, I have no future fight plans and I am ok with that.  Fighting was a fun and interesting part of my life but I've moved on to competing in archery on the local, state, and national level which occupies a good part of my free time now. Archery is also a little less taxing on the body than fighting was...  ðŸ˜†
